## Vercel-Github Integration

### Pull Request Previews

Vercel automatically integrates with pull requests, generating a preview deployment based on the latest commit to a pull request.

Here's an example of a automatic preview deployment that appears as soon as you make a pull request on github - no action required by you.

### Automated Deployments

When a pull request has been merged into the `main` branch, vercel will automatically deploy that merge commit to the relevant project's production deployment
